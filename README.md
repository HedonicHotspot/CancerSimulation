Project Title: Simulating Cellular Dynamics: Uncooperative Cells and Treatment Strategies
Project Description
This project uses a computational model to simulate the dynamics of cellular cooperation and competition within a biological system. The model explores the impact of uncooperative cells, akin to cancer cells, on system stability and the potential effectiveness of combined fasting and chemotherapy interventions in restoring stability.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) or later
RStudio (optional)
Installation
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/HedonicHotspot/CancerSimulation.git
Open RStudio and set your working directory to the cloned repository.
Install the necessary R packages using the install.packages("package-name") command.
Usage
Run the main script (main.R) to start the simulation. The script will generate a series of graphs representing different conditions: Healthy System, Uncooperative Cell Introduction, Fasting, Chemotherapy, and Fasted Chemotherapy. Each graph plots four variables - mean altruism, normalized cell population, normalized mean cell resource, and percent cancer cells - against the number of rounds.
